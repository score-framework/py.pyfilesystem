    Initializes this module acoording to the :ref:`SCORE module initialization
    guidelines <module_initialization>` with the following configuration keys:

    :confkey:`ctx.member.url` :confdefault:`fs`
        The name of the :term:`context member`, that should be registered with
        the configured :mod:`score.ctx` module (if there is one). The default
        value allows you to always access configured file systems within a
        :class:`score.ctx.Context` like the following:

        >>> ctx.fs['my_configured_fs']

    :confkey:`path.*`
        Configuration keys like `path.foo` are file system definitions that must
        contain a valid :ref:`pyfilesystem URL <pyfilesystem:fs-urls>`. These
        values automatically :meth:`register
        <ConfiguredPyfilesystemModule.register_path>` paths during
        initialization. The following example is for registering a memory file
        system called `foo`:

        .. code-block:: ini

            path.foo = mem://

        The only customization is a *scope* parameter, which can also define the
        :term:`scope <pyfilesystem scope>` of a file system. Valid values for
        this parameter are ``global`` (the default) and ``ctx``. The same
        filesystem as above with a scope bound to a context would look like
        this:

        .. code-block:: ini

            path.foo = mem://?scope=ctx
